# My Memory Palace

This application was written in React using Redux. It's my third attempt at
this concept -- each time, I've tried to move closer and closer to doing React
the "right way", and I think that this time, I've hit pretty close to correct.
There are still concepts I don't entirely understand, and features I'd like to
build, so I'm sure improvements will be coming in the future, but I doubt I'd
be creating an entirely different version going forward.

If you'd like to see the application in action, you can check out it's website
